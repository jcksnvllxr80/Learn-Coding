## What is a script
a list of commands that get ran in order
## prerequisites
- python

the command to run the script
`python <name-of-script>.py`

## Breakdown
Let's breakdown each part of `python <name-of-script>.py`:

**1. `python`**

- This is the program's name
- It tells the computer "Hey, use Python to run something!"
- Python is a programming language (a way to talk to computers)

**2. The space**

- This separates the command parts
- It's like taking a breath between words

**3. `<name-of-script>.py`**

- This is the file you want to run
- The `<name-of-script>` part is a placeholder - you replace it with your actual file name
- For example, if your file is called `game`, you'd type `game.py`
- The `.py` at the end tells the computer "this is a Python file"

**Putting it all together:**

If you had a Python file called `hello.py`, you'd type:

```
python hello.py
```

**Think of it like this:**

- `python` = "Hey Python program!"
- `hello.py` = "Please run this file for me!"

It's like telling your friend "Hey Sarah, read this book called 'Adventure Story'" - you're telling who should do something (`python`) and what they should do it with (`your-file.py`).
