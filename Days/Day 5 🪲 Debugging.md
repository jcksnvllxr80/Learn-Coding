### “Fixing Mistakes — Debugging”

**Goal:** Learn that mistakes are normal and fixing them is part of coding.  

---

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the idea**  
Say:

> “Even the best programmers make mistakes.  
> Finding and fixing them is called _debugging_.  
> Today we’ll practice that.”

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Run a program with a bug**  
Type this **exactly**:

```python
print("Welcome to my program!")
print("Let's count to three.")
print("One")
print("Two")
pritn("Three")
```

Run it.  
It will show an **error** like:

```
NameError: name 'pritn' is not defined
```

Ask:

> “What do you think went wrong?”  
> Let her notice the misspelled `pritn`.

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Fix the bug**  
Change `pritn` to `print`, then run again.

🎉 It works!

Explain:

> “See? The computer didn’t understand because we made a tiny typo.  
> Debugging means finding where things go wrong and fixing them.”

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  
Ask:

> “Did the computer get mad at us? No — it just told us where it got confused.”  
> “Debugging is just helping the computer understand our plan.”

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

> Mistakes are part of coding.  
> Debugging means finding what went wrong and fixing it patiently.
