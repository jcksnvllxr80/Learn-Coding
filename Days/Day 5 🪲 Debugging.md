#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the idea**  

Even the best programmers make mistakes. Finding and fixing them is called _debugging_. Today you'll practice that.

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Run a program with a bug**  
Type this **exactly**:

```python
print("Welcome to my program!")
print("Let's count to three.")
print("One")
print("Two")
pritn("Three")
```

Run it.  
It shows an **error** like:

```
NameError: name 'pritn' is not defined
```

What do you think went wrong? Notice the misspelled `pritn`.

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Fix the bug**  
Change `pritn` to `print`, then run again.

🎉 It works!

See? The computer didn't understand because you made a tiny typo. Debugging means finding where things go wrong and fixing them.

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  

Did the computer get mad at you? No — it just told you where it got confused. Debugging is just helping the computer understand your plan.

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

Mistakes are part of coding. Debugging means finding what went wrong and fixing it patiently.
