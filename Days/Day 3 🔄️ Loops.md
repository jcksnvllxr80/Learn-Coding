### “Repeating Without Rewriting”

**Goal:** Discover that loops let the computer repeat steps automatically.  

---

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the idea**  
Say:

> “Sometimes we want the computer to do the same thing many times.  
> Instead of writing it over and over, we can make it repeat — that’s called a _loop_.”

---

**Step 2 (2 min): The long way first**  
Type this:

```python
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
```

Run it.  
Ask:

> “What if we wanted 100 claps? That would take forever to type!”

---

**Step 3 (1 min): The loop way**  
Erase that and type:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Clap!")
```

Run it again.  
Explain gently:

> “`for i in range(5):` means ‘do this 5 times.’  
> The line under it is what repeats.”

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Play and reflect**  
Try changing the 5 to 10, or the word “Clap!” to “Jump!”

Then ask:

> “Did you have to copy and paste it anymore?”

Wrap up with:

> “Loops let us repeat things easily — and computers love repeating!”

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

> A loop repeats instructions without you writing them again.  
> Code can save effort — that’s what makes it powerful.
