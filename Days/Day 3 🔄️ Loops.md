### "Repeating Without Rewriting"

**Goal:** Discover that loops let the computer repeat steps automatically.

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the idea**  

Sometimes you want the computer to do the same thing many times. Instead of writing it over and over, you can make it repeat — that's called a _loop_.

---

**Step 2 (2 min): The long way first**  
Type this:

```python
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
print("Clap!")
```

Run it.  
What if you wanted 100 claps? That would take forever to type!

---

**Step 3 (1 min): The loop way**  
Erase that and type:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Clap!")
```

Run it again.  
`for i in range(5):` means 'do this 5 times.' The line under it is what repeats.

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Play and reflect**  
Try changing the 5 to 10, or the word "Clap!" to "Jump!"

Did you have to copy and paste it anymore?

Loops let you repeat things easily — and computers love repeating!

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

A loop repeats instructions without you writing them again. Code can save effort — that's what makes it powerful.
