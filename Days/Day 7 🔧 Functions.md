### "Reusable Code Blocks — Functions"

**Goal:** Learn that functions are like recipes you can use over and over.

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the scene**  

A function is like a recipe. You write the steps once, give it a name, then you can "call" it whenever you need it. This saves time and keeps your code organized.

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Your first function**  
Type this code and click **Run**:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello there!")
    print("Welcome to my program!")

say_hello()
```

🎉 The function ran and printed both messages!

The `def` keyword creates a function. The parentheses `()` are where you could put ingredients (we'll learn that later). The indented lines are the "recipe steps."

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Use it multiple times**  

Try calling your function several times:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello there!")
    print("Welcome to my program!")

say_hello()
say_hello()
say_hello()
```

See how you wrote the code once but used it three times? That's the power of functions!

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  

Notice these key points:

- Did you have to rewrite the print statements each time?
- What happened when you called `say_hello()` multiple times?

Functions let you write code once and use it many times. This makes your programs shorter and easier to manage.

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

Functions are like recipes — you define them once with `def`, then call them by name whenever you need them.
