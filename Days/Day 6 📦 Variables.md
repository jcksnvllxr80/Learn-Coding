### "Storing Information — Variables"

**Goal:** Learn that variables are like labeled boxes that hold information.

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the scene**  

A variable is like a box with a label. You can put something inside and use it later. In Python, you create variables by giving them names and values.

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Your first variables**  
Type each line, one at a time, and click **Run** after each.

```python
name = "Alex"
age = 10
print("Hello, my name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")
```

🎉 The computer remembered what you stored in `name` and `age`!

The `=` sign means "store this value in this box." Now you can use `name` and `age` anywhere in your program.

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Experiment**  

Try changing the values:

```python
name = "Sam"
age = 12
print("Hello, my name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")
```

What happens when you run it again? The computer uses the new values!

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  

Notice these key points:

- Did you have to retype "Alex" and "10" everywhere?
- What happened when you changed the variable values?

Variables let you store information once and use it many times. If you need to change something, you only change it in one place.

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

Variables are like labeled boxes that store information. You can put things in them and use them later in your program.
