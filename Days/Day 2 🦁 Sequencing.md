### “Order Matters”

**Goal:** Understand that the _order_ of instructions changes the result.

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Quick reminder**  
Say:

> “Yesterday we told the computer what to say.  
> Today we’ll see what happens if we change the _order_ of our commands.”

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Run this little story**  
Type and run:

```python
print("Step 1: Get out of bed")
print("Step 2: Brush teeth")
print("Step 3: Eat breakfast")
```

Explain:

> “That’s your morning program — the computer runs it one line at a time, top to bottom.”

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Mix it up**  
Now swap two lines — for example, move “Eat breakfast” above “Brush teeth”:

```python
print("Step 1: Get out of bed")
print("Step 2: Eat breakfast")
print("Step 3: Brush teeth")
```

Run it again.  
Ask her:

> “Does it still make sense? What changed?”

Laugh together — it’s silly _but memorable._

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  
Say:

> “See? The computer doesn’t know which order is ‘right.’  
> It just follows our list exactly.  
> That’s why _sequencing_ is so important in coding.”

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

> The order of lines in code changes what happens — just like steps in real life.
