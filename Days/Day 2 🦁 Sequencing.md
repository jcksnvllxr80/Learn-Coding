### "Order Matters"

**Goal:** Understand that the _order_ of instructions changes the result.

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Quick reminder**  

Yesterday you told the computer what to say. Today you'll see what happens if you change the _order_ of your commands.

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Run this little story**  
Type and run:

```python
print("Step 1: Get out of bed")
print("Step 2: Brush teeth")
print("Step 3: Eat breakfast")
```

That's your morning program — the computer runs it one line at a time, top to bottom.

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Mix it up**  
Now swap two lines — for example, move "Eat breakfast" above "Brush teeth":

```python
print("Step 1: Get out of bed")
print("Step 2: Eat breakfast")
print("Step 3: Brush teeth")
```

Run it again.  
Does it still make sense? What changed?

It's silly _but memorable._

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  

See? The computer doesn't know which order is 'right.' It just follows your list exactly. That's why _sequencing_ is so important in coding.

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

The order of lines in code changes what happens — just like steps in real life.
