### "Telling the Computer What to Do"

**Goal:** Understand that a computer does exactly what you tell it, no more and no less.

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the scene**  

Python is a way to talk to the computer. You tell it what to do, step by step — just like giving a robot directions.

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Your first commands**  
Type each line, one at a time, and click **Run** after each.

`print("Hello!") print("I am learning Python.")`

🎉 You'll see those words appear — _instant feedback!_

Each `print` tells the computer to say something on the screen. Computers follow one line after another, in order.

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Experiment**  

Try these changes:

- What happens if you change the words?
- What if you add one more line like this?

`print("I love ice cream!")`

Run it again and see the results.

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  

Notice these key points:

- Did the computer add anything by itself?
- Did it skip or mix the lines?

Computers don't guess — they do exactly what you type, in order. That's the heart of coding.

✅ **Takeaway:**

A _program_ is just a list of clear instructions. Python's `print()` is like saying a command out loud.
