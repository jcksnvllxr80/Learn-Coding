### “Telling the Computer What to Do”

**Goal:** Understand that a computer does exactly what you tell it, no more and no less.

---

#### 🕐 **Total time: ≈ 5 minutes**

**Step 1 (1 min): Set the scene**  
Say:

> “Python is a way to talk to the computer.  
> We’ll tell it what to do, step by step — just like giving a robot directions.”

---

**Step 2 (2 min): Your first commands**  
Type each line, one at a time, and click **Run** after each.

`print("Hello!") print("I am learning Python.")`

🎉 She’ll see those words appear — _instant feedback!_

Explain:

> “Each `print` tells the computer to say something on the screen.  
> Computers follow one line after another, in order.”

---

**Step 3 (1 min): Experiment**  
Ask her:

- “What happens if you change the words?”
    
- “What if we add one more line like this?”
    

`print("I love ice cream!")`

Encourage her to run it again and giggle at the results.

---

**Step 4 (1 min): Reflect**  
Ask:

> “Did the computer add anything by itself?”  
> “Did it skip or mix the lines?”

Explain:

> “Computers don’t guess — they do exactly what you type, in order.  
> That’s the heart of coding.”

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

> A _program_ is just a list of clear instructions.  
> Python’s `print()` is like saying a command out loud.
